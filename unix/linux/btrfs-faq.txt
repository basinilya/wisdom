Q: restore an incremental backup from a backups server
A:
- There's already "/snapdir/last-good" readonly snapshot on the backups server (name may differ).
  If there's no, there's nothing to restore

- There's already "/snapdir/current-bad" readonly snapshot on the victim server created by daily backup program
  If there's no, the only option is to "btrfs send" the whole subvolume from the backups server

- On the backups server launch:
    btrfs send -p "/snapdir/current-bad" "/snapdir/last-good" | ssh root@victim "receiver command..."

- On the victim server the receiver command will be: btrfs receive "/snapdir"
  The readonly snapshot "/snapdir/last-good" is created

- Take a read-write snapshot of "/snapdir/last-good"
  btrfs subvol snapshot "/snapdir/last-good" "/snapdir/last-good-rw"

- Boot into "/snapdir/last-good-rw"


Q: Boot into subvol
A: 
- option 1: btrfs subvolume set-default
    After remount or reboot the previous default will be available at: ???
- option 2: 
  grub.cfg: rootflags=subvol=...
  /etc/fstab subvol=...
