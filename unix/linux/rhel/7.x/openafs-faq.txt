Q: benefits
A: 
  vs NFS:
    - Dynamic fileserver address
    - Low fileserver phaseout downtime
    - One FS "/afs" (Linux autofs nullifies this benefit)

  vs GlusterFS (with one remote brick and a local tier):
    - WAN performance better


Q: drawbacks
A:
  - "Caching" no better than NFS with cachefilesd
  - Disconnected operation `fs discon on` not automatic
  - Multi-homed peers unsupported
  - Clients with NAT unsupported (compare exports(5) insecure)
  - chown only for system:administrators (compare exports(5) no_root_squash)


Q: bos: can't open cell database (/etc/openafs/server)
A:
  check:
    /etc/openafs/server/CellServDB
    /etc/openafs/server/ThisCell
    /etc/openafs/server/krb.conf
      (must not be empty)

Q:
    cd /afs/.:mount/${cellname}:root.afs/
    fs mkmount ${cellname} root.cell -cell ${cellname}
    fs: You don't have the required access rights on 'localcell'
    ls /afs/.:mount/${cellname:?}:root.afs/
    ls: cannot open directory /afs/.:mount/localcell:root.afs/: Permission denied

A:
    fileserver thinks your token is anonymous. Check krb.conf

Q:
    echo 192.168.140.113 >/var/openafs/NetInfo
    ln -sfT /var/openafs/NetInfo /etc/openafs/server/NetInfo
    
    /var/openafs/logs/VLLog
        The following fileserver is being registered in the VLDB:
              [192.168.140.113]
           It will replace the following existing entry in the VLDB (same uuid):
              entry 0: [192.168.140.113 10.8.1.33]

A:
  TODO


Q:
  in client syslog/journal:
    kernel: afs: Lost contact with file server 10.8.1.33 in cell localcell (code -1) (multi-homed address; other same-host interfaces maybe up)

A:
  TODO?
  workaround: NetInfo

Q: increase debug level
A:
  pkill -TSTP fileserver # twice enough
  tail -F /var/openafs/logs/FileLog
  
  pkill -TSTP ptserver # twice enough
  tail -F /var/openafs/logs/PtLog


Q:
A:

It sounds like you want to use IP ACL's as Harmut suggests.

# as an AFS admin, run the following:
pts createuser 192.168.148.156
pts creategroup homeusers
pts adduser 192.168.148.156 homeusers
fs setacl /afs/.localcell/home homeusers rlidwk
