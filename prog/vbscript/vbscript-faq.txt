Q: ?
A: 
  VBScript has only limited capability of working with byte arrays. The VarType function does return 8209, which indicates:
  vbArray 8192 Array
  vbByte 17 Byte subtype,
  but you cannot use VBScript's array syntax to access individual elements of the array.

  Conversion can be made with adodb.stream
