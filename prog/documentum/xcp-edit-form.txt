Always create a fragment from an Edit template
You'll get an undeletable "id" and "model" inputs.

In the .fragment xml this will add an extra templateScope="INSTANCE" attribute to the root element.


This fragment CAN be used to create new, but you need to pass (undefined) to the "id" input by using the expression:
{''}[-1]
Just passing an empty string won't work.


Also, a model output can be added to the same fragment, you need to add an output named "model".

Its default value must be the artifact, not Inputs.model

Close and reopen

Now you can expand the output model.

Set each property to the value of an input widget


Do not use the artifact "id" property to distinguish new and edit.
When working with a new instance the "id" property of the model is populated anyway.

If the table is not empty, then the first found object id is used. If it's empty a dummy value is used.

To distinguish new and edit use Inputs.id or Inputs.model.id or both
