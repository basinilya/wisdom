Result List with ARQ guide

- have default sorting
- sort case insensitive
- have "Displaying Page 1 of n"

If the query returns col1, col2, etc.
the query string MUST begin with:

  select
  lower(col1) as l_col1,
  lower(col2) as l_col2,
  ...
  col1, col2, ...

This is to have default sort by "col1", case insensitive.
The query will have "order by 1" unless "Sort By" is non-empty or until a column header is clicked.

The query MUST end with

  order by ?

Otherwise the columns cannot be sortable.

The input parameters in ARQ are dollar-quoted, uppercase: $PARAM$

Multivalue (repeating) parameters MUST be used in a in() clause: in($PARAM$)

When you press "SyncQuery" the Multivalued checkbox is not preserved (bug).
When you press "Finish", the "Enable Sorting" checkbox is not preserved (bug).

After closing the "Validate DQL Query" window go to the "Output Columns" section and check the "Enable Sorting" checkboxes, at least, for the lowercase columns.

Attach the ARQ to the Result List.

Remove all non-lowercase columns

Click all the remaining columns and check the "Can be used to sort" checkbox.

Set the columns property "Display" the actual non-lowercase data column.

Clear the "Width" property of the last column

Create a copy of the ARQ and name it "Existing Name Count"

Wrap the DQL with:

  select count(*) from (
  ...
  ) t

Make sure all multivalue input properties are marked

Enable the Result List property "Display Record Count" and use the following expression:

  arrayMax( { <Count-ARQ>.count[0], 1 } )

This is to avoid "Displaying Page 1 of 0"

To enable a tooltip for a cell, change the "Data Type" to "HTML" and set the value to: 

  '<span title="' + htmlEncode(Outputs.supp_address) + '">'+ htmlEncode(Outputs.supp_address) + '</span>'
