4.1.2

- failed to delete jar after undeploy

  leak in GF prevents deletion of EJB module dependency previously deployed with:
  asadmin deploy --libraries "path\to\dependency.jar" "path\to\standalone-module.jar"


4.1.1

- NoClassDefFoundError ignored in @PostConstruct:

    Severe:   Class ... not found. Error while loading ...
    Info:   appnanme was successfully deployed in 9 172 milliseconds.

- <resource-ref> and <jdbc-resource> cannot be used as <jta-datasource>

  Invalid resource : { ResourceInfo : (jndiName=java:app/jdbc/JavaProjectRessource__pm), (applicationName=JavaProject) }

  It's because the resources aren't yet registered. In ApplicationLifecycle.deploy it calls prepareModule
  and only after that it calls ApplicationInfo.load which binds the names.
