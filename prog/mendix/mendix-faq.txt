Q: Call a nanoflow in a javascript action
A:
  The easiest is to create a parameter of the type 'Nanoflow' in the javascript action.
  The passed parameter will be of the type 'function' returning a Promise and
  accepting a single parameter of the type 'JS object' whose properties are the
  nanoflow's named parameters.

Q: replicate SAML SP certificate to another Environment
A: 
  - On the source app go to SP Metadata and download the JKS
  - On the target app go to SP Metadata and upload the JKS, then click
    "Download SP Metadata" one time. This will extract the certificate
    from the JKS and save it in SPMetadata object

Q: entity ID type ID, sequences etc.
A: 
  The real sequence objects are only used for autonumber attributes.
  
  CREATE MEMORY TABLE PUBLIC."mendixsystem$entityidentifier"(
  "id" VARCHAR(36) COLLATE INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SQL_TEXT_UCC NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  "short_id" SMALLINT,
  "object_sequence" BIGINT
  )
  INSERT INTO "mendixsystem$entityidentifier" VALUES('b1103c3a-5b42-4b6a-9458-653525793e0d',141,12901)
  8d
  3265

  INSERT INTO "avatarmain$vaitem" VALUES(39687971716214161,NULL,FALSE,11567,0,'KwaZulu-Natal','ZAKZN')
  008d 0000 0000 2d91
  
  short_id is part of the ID

  https://forum.mendix.com/link/questions/4441
  >
  The long version is that in Mendix 4 we don't automatically insert objects into
  the database when creating them, for performance reasons and for making
  transient objects work. Obviously we still need unique identifiers for objects
  which is why we reserve batches of identifiers up front.
  
  Multiple Mendix Runtime servers with the same application can operate on a
  single database so this is all done neatly in transactions such that one server
  can claim a set of identifiers and immediately updates the table keeping these,
  the next server will never claim the same range.
  
  These identifiers are currently reserved in sets of 100 at a time and their
  current number is kept in a special system table called
  mendixsystem$entityidentifier with 1 row per entity. These rows are stored by
  entity id, the entity name can be found in mendixsystem$entity.
  
  When identifiers are about to run out, we can do an asynchronous database query
  claiming some more identifiers. If a runtime server stops then the ids not
  spent are basically lost, which is not an issue since the identifiers are 48
  bits.
  
  The actual identifiers you will see in the id column are made up of these 48
  bits (least significant) AND an additional 16 bits (most significant)
  indicating what entity type they actually are. This is needed for inheritance
  and this part is fixed for a certain entity in a specific database. This number
  is the column short_id in the entityidentifier table.
  
  I honestly think you'll have too much trouble getting this to work in a
  guaranteed bug-free way, and any mistakes here could seriously corrupt your
  database. Additionally, we can change this implementation since this is
  internal server logic. Is there no other way to do what you want to achieve?


Q: menus don't work in topbar
A: 
  1. Make sure you have:
  
    .layout-atlas .region-topbar {
        z-index: auto;
    }
  
  2. Make sure there's no overflow:hidden in any parents

Q: Add a trigger button to a regular input widget
A:
  wrap the input and the button with a container, set the container class my-input-with-trigger-container
  add the following to the custom styles:

  div.my-input-with-trigger-container {
  	position: relative;
  
  	&> div {
  		&> div > input {
  			margin-right: 50px;
  		}
  	}
  
  	&> button {
  		position: absolute;
  		right: 0;
  		top: 0;
  	}
  }


Q: get React Component instance
A:
  React widgets are wrapped with dojo mxui.widget.ReactCustomWidgetWrapper
  It stores no reference to the React component
  Its domNode.parentNode is null
  Its _markerNode property is an <!-- HTML Comment --> and is a previous sibling of the actual widget node

  It's easier to skip obtaining ReactCustomWidgetWrapper and find the React Component directly from the widget DOM Node:
    FindReact(dom) // see below
  Simplified:
    dom.__reactFiber$xxx.return.stateNode
  
  Alternatively, the React Component can be found via:
    (obj as ReactCustomWidgetWrapper)._markerNode.__reactContainer$xxx.child.child.stateNode  

  // https://stackoverflow.com/a/39165137/447503
  function FindReact(dom, traverseUp = 0) {
      const key = Object.keys(dom).find(key=>{
          return key.startsWith("__reactFiber$") // react 17+
              || key.startsWith("__reactInternalInstance$"); // react <17
      });
      const domFiber = dom[key];
      if (domFiber == null) return null;
  
      // react <16
      if (domFiber._currentElement) {
          let compFiber = domFiber._currentElement._owner;
          for (let i = 0; i < traverseUp; i++) {
              compFiber = compFiber._currentElement._owner;
          }
          return compFiber._instance;
      }
  
      // react 16+
      const GetCompFiber = fiber=>{
          //return fiber._debugOwner; // this also works, but is __DEV__ only
          let parentFiber = fiber.return;
          while (typeof parentFiber.type == "string") {
              parentFiber = parentFiber.return;
          }
          return parentFiber;
      };
      let compFiber = GetCompFiber(domFiber);
      for (let i = 0; i < traverseUp; i++) {
          compFiber = GetCompFiber(compFiber);
      }
      return compFiber.stateNode;
  }


Q: custom javascript
A: 
  From Marketplace install HTML Snippet
  Add the addon widget HTML Snippet to the form
  In Widget properties switch to Javascript mode

  An empty Div will be created

  The js is eval'ed, attempt to return will fail. 
  Evaluation error is caught and displayed in a nested balloon.

  In case of External File script it's executed synchronously in a tag: <script src="custom.js?cacheid">
  where custom.js is a file inside theme/web/
  jquery will not work
  
  
  In case of inline script
  A non-JQuery snippet is run synchronously
  `this` refers to the current widget (dojo based)

  A JQuery snippet is deferred by window.require(["jquery"], function(jQuery) { ... })
  `this` refers to an object:
  {
      jquery: jQuery, // pass JQuery as the context of the immediate function which will wrap the code snippet
      widget: widget    // pass the HTMLSnippet widget context itself, so the code could use listen/addOnDestroy
  }
  
  widget.__proto__.declaredClass === "HTMLSnippet.widget.HTMLSnippet"
    "mxui.widget._WidgetBase"
      "uniqName_0"
        "dijit._WidgetBase"
          "dijit.Destroyable"
            "dojo.Stateful"


  this.contextObj is an optional current instance of an entity
  
  this.domNode === this.srcNodeRef refers to the widget Div HTMLNode

  this.domNode.parentElement refers to the container HTMLNode
  
  dijit.getEnclosingWidget(this.domNode.parentNode) returns the parent widget

  To find a neighbour widget use:
  HTMLNode.querySelectorAll('.mx-someclass');

A: legacy, used in BCo or the [%CurrentObject%] from the client
  https://forum.mendix.com/link/questions/7036


Q:
  Import Mapping marks existing objects dirty even though no value actually changes
A:
  Unlike "Change Object" action Import Mapping does not use 
  com.mendix.basis.action.user.Changer.setMemberValue
    (or Changer.isDifferentValue())
  and instead calls IMendixObject.setValue() directly

Q: No access to microflow X for user role Y
A:

Q: Removal or rename of attributes in external entity key for entity 'X.Y' is not supported.
A: 

Q: flow is not accepted by origin or destination
A: first choose "set error handling" from context menu, then mark the flow as error handler

Q: Internationalize display values in Reference Selector
A: https://forum.mendix.com/link/questions/5419
  TL/DR: Use a calculated attribute.
  For languages, instead of an attribute with a code, associate your entity with System$Language

Q: Dropdown without association
A:
  Custom Dropdown https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/117326
  It really is fully customizable, but setting its mandatory properties is a lot of work
  Also, the English translation is awful so instead of guessing what those properties do better see the doc and the test application here https://github.com/mendixlabs/CustomDropdown/tree/main/tests/testProject

A: https://apidocs.rnd.mendix.com/9/client/mx.ui.html

Q: set user role in micrflow
A: 
  retrieve the userrole object by xpath of the form [id='[%UserRole_RoleName%]']
  Assign as a regular association

Q: empty string
A: a string can be empty (null) or it can be empty string (''). You need both checks

Q: Check the state of an object ("Instantiated", "Committed", dirty) without using java
A: 
  somewhat - isNew()
  isChanged() is only available in Java
  Warning: isSynced() is only meaningful in offline apps in Client Expressions

Q: how to debug custom java
A: locally - when you deploy for Eclipse it creates a launch configuration for that. Remotely, I don't know.

Q: Error during startup in Eclipse
A: eclipse project properties -> Java Build Path -> Execution Environment -> JavaSE-11

Q: Log a message
A:
		ILogNode logger = Core.getLogger(ENU_LogModule.MyFirstModule.name());
		logger.info("some");
		logger.error(new Exception());


Q: get current request
A:
	// BEGIN EXTRA CODE

		IContext ctx = getContext();
		Optional<IMxRuntimeRequest> orr = ctx.getRuntimeRequest();
		String realIP = null;
		if (orr.isPresent()) {

		    HttpServletRequest request = rr.getHttpServletRequest();
		    realIP = rr.getHeader("X-Real-IP");
		    if( realIP == null )
		        realIP = rr.getHeader("X-Forwarded-For");
		    if( realIP == null )
		        realIP = rr.getRemoteAddr();
		}
		return realIP;
	}
	// END EXTRA CODE


Q: Redirect the logs to a custom logging framework
A:
  Warning! the method processMessage() is called in a dedicated thread. It's pointless to try enrich the log message with Thread.currentThread.getName()
  
  In "After startup":
	@java.lang.Override
	public java.lang.Void executeAction() throws Exception
	{
		// BEGIN USER CODE
		LogSubscriber subs = new LogSubscriber("mysubscr", LogLevel.TRACE) {
			@Override
			public void processMessage(LogMessage arg0) {
				System.out.println(arg0.message);
			}
		};
		Core.registerLogSubscriber(subs);

Q: Jave Thread name in log messages to extract message sequences for specific threads.
A: It's not logged. See what object is passed to com.mendix.logging.impl.LogManager.registerLogSubscriber and maybe reconfigure it or extend its class.
  Or register your own LogSubscriber that logs the current thread and or current HTTP request.

Q: Integrate Java Actions that use other logging frameworks
A: In "After startup"
  register an appender that calls Core.getLogger ... info/error/...
  Make sure it doesn't recursively call the same logging framework via LogSubscriber


Q: Reference Selector vs Reference Set Selector vs Input Reference Set Selector
A: These widgets allow editing associations. They require the current object to be an association owner. They still require the "Save" button.

Reference Selector only works with "one to x" associations. It can associate one or zero parent objects with the current object. In drop-down mode it displays a chosen attribute of the parent object.

The other two widgets only work with "many to many" associations" and they require a _Select page with a data grid (preferred) or a list view of parent candidates and a "Save changes" button.
When a pop-up with a data grid is invoked by one of the selector widgets some of its rows are auto-selected and the "Select" button associates the selected parents with the current child object without committing it.
When a pop-up with a list view is invoked by one of the selector widgets it gains an implicit checkbox widget in each row of the list view and the "Save changes" button associates the checked parents with the current child object without committing it.
Important: the filtering must be done on the "Selectable Objects" tab of the reference set widget, not in the grid or list view data source.
In the "Selectable Objects" xpath you can use the '[%CurrentObject%]' token to filter by the child object.
There is no '[%CurrentObject%]' in Select Page.

Input Reference Set Selector looks like a readonly dropdown in which the chosen attribute of the selected parents is
shown in a comma-separated list. It also has an active trigger button that invokes the _Select pop-up. In the pop-up
already associated objects have their checkboxes checked.
The current entity can be non-persistable, but the associated entity MUST be persistable.

Reference Set Selector looks like a data grid and displays the attributes of parent objects. By default it has
"Search Bar Toggle", "Add", and "Remove" buttons. The "Add" button invokes the _Select pop-up.
Both the current entity and the associated entity MUST be persistable.
In the pop-up already associated objects don't have their checkboxes checked and it looks like a bug in Mendix
8.17.0. However, checking them does not cause any error.
Besides, Reference Set Selector ignores the readonlyness of the current container.


Q: Why at https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/36/lecture/200/3.4-Knowledge-Check
  Question 4: In which of the following microflows would applying entity access NOT be recommended?
  [x]A microflow to display a company overview to anonymous users.
  and not
  [ ]A microflow that generates a report on the productivity of all the app users.

Q: standard list view CSS classes
A: 
  ,

Q: Ternary operator (?:) in expressions
A: In Mendix if-then-else is not void and can be used in expressions: 'c' + (if true then 'a' else 'u') + 't'

Q: What kind of tokens does the at-sign (@) precede in expressions? Ex:
  @EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV.EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV + '/' + toString (EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV.EntitySetNames.Products) + '?$filter=substringof(SubCategoryName,''' + urlEncode($SearchCriteria/Term) + ''')'
A: Constants

Q: How to implement a custom microflow activity that runs other activities placed in it just like the Loop activity does?

Q: Custom functions in expressions (client or runtime or both)?

Q: How to delay searching in a data widget until the search button is pressed?

Q: Custom widget with a property where I select another widget on the page?
A: You can't. Instead use a string property and use the widget name. See List View Swipe/Target list view.
  Or have no property and just dynamically find the adjacent widget. See List View controls.
  Or if the widget to choose is an input widget then use a property of type "Attribute" and set it to the same attribute as the input widget. Then find the widget by the attribute.

Q: When are alerts cleared?

Q: if starting with Mendix 7 the object cache only exists on client how does the cached retrieve by association work?

Q: How to create an error handler in a microflow?
A: Right click an action and choose "Set error handling...", drag an outgoing sequence flow, right click the arrow and choose "Set as error handler" (important).

Q: View the development database
A: Console view: Advanced/Start built-in database viewer (maybe requires a running app)

Q: How does Retrieve work in microflows in case of no read access to _some_ attributes (when entity access is enforced)?

Q: Does Entity Access apply to Retrieve in Microflows without that checkbox checked?

Q: Do Log Levels persist between runs in Studio Pro?
A: yes

Q: Why at https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/374/lecture/3053/7.8-Knowledge-Check
  Question 1: When localize is set to No, the date displayed in the client is based on the:
  [x]Client time zone
  and not
  [ ]UTC value
  ?
A: must be poor wording. Tests show that it's based on the UTC value

Q: Why at https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/374/lecture/3053/7.8-Knowledge-Check
  Question 3: If both the Project and User time zone are set, the value of the localized DateTime attribute displayed in the client is according to:
  [x]The Client timezone
  and not
  [ ]The User timezone
  ?
A: The answer is correct. The localized time is based on the browser timezone and ignores the user timezone.

Q: In what timezone do date arithmetic functions in microflows work, especially when working with non-localized date attributes?
A: in the caller timezone. Alternatively, use the xxxUTC() variants of the functions like addDaysUTC()

Q: how to change association direction in domain model?
A: the button is only available in Mendix Studio (Web)

Q: Do non-persistable objects stay after page refresh?
A: no

Q: When retrieving in batches with custom Limit/Offset it's very easy to miss some objects or process them twice if the records were deleted/inserted during retrieval
A: this is mentioned in the courses: https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/21/lecture/85/3.3-Using-Batches
  > The new record set is retrieved, but since you didnt define a sort order, the retrieve arbitrarily returns the list in no specific order
  So use sorting and maybe it will help. Sorting by internal id is not supported anyway and we don't know if the internal ID monotonic. So use autonumber attribute.

Q: Why instead of setting a role-based home page for Anonymous I have to make the login page default home page and set the role-based home page for every other role?
  https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/183/lecture/1426/3.7.3-Creating-a-Custom-Login-Page
  > Open the Project Navigation and set the newly created login page as the Default home page.
A: No good reason. Anonymous-specific home page works fine.

Q: When uploading a logo via Theme Customizer (web) a GUID is appended to the file path in the .scss file. What is it?

Q: Send %CurrentObject% to a microflow associated with the "New" button in a data grid
A: data grid button "New" pre-associates the new object when the grid datasource is "By Association". It can't do that for other data sources.

Q:
  https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/184/lecture/1440/4.3-The-Reference-Set-Selector
  > The reference set selector is the widget you use in Mendix to select associated objects ...
  > You can configure the widget to show the options in a dropdown or in a select page
  You can't make it dropdown


Q: buttons with pull-right class have inverted order in design mode

Q: New pages not listed in "page access"
A: Fill "Visible for" in page properties

Q: Before Commit returning false, but without error does not stop a microflow (it prevents "Save changes" on click action though)
Some autocommitted objects still existed on logout for session 'demo_administrator'.
Autocommitted objects are newly created objects which were not yet committed, but are inserted into the database because an associated object was committed.
Autocommitted objects should explicitly have been committed, please check your model and apply the necessary changes. The autocommitted objects have been deleted from the database to prevent database corruption.Number of autocommitted objects per type which still existed for this session:
- Expenses.TeamMember: 1 object(s).


Q: Image Viewer not updated when new image is selected in Image Uploader widget
A: Image Uploader actually uploads the file only when you click the "Save" button on the same page. It somehow detects the proper button and chains itself to the button's action.

Q: How does the Image Uploader widget subscribe to the form submit and how does it distinguish real submit and the cancel action? How does it make sure the upload precedes the user-configured action?

Q: how to cancel changes when editor page abandoned by clicking navigation menu?

Q: get Mendix object ID
A: CommunityCommons/GetGUID()

Q: get object by ID string
A: 
  Mendix 7 had the form: id('ID_123423462342 ID_123423462343 ID_123423462344')
  https://docs.mendix.com/refguide7/xpath-id

  There's an alternative syntax:
  https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/xpath-expressions
  //Sales.Customer[Sales.Customer_Order = 'ID_124123512341']
  
  However they both aren't supported by Mendix 8+

Q: xpath constraint with unrelated entities
A: not possible

Q: How to filter in Retrieve by ID? How to obtain the ID of an object? How to sort in Retrieve by ID?
A: you can't

Q: current object in client xpath
A:

Q: escaping in XPath
A: concat() is not supported. Use XML entities. Ex:
  Larry "Basher" O'Niven
  [attr = 'Larry "Basher" O&apos;Niven']
  [attr = "Larry &quot;Basher&quot; O'Niven"]
  This totally works in Mendix 8 in datasource constraints in data widgets

  Community Commons have the utility function
    XPath.valueToXPathValue(Object)

Q: escaping in OQL

Q: escaping in expressions
A: partial answer: SQL-like double apostrophe
  @GWSAMPLE_BASIC.GWSAMPLE_BASIC + '/' + toString(GWSAMPLE_BASIC.EntitySetNames.ProductSet) + '(''HT-1000'')'
  This produces the GET request https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/ProductSet('HT-1000')

  urlDecode('%FF') can also be used

Q: Why can I compare '[%CurrentUser%]' with the association Xxx.Xxx_Account and not Xxx.Xxx_Account/System.Account ?
A: Because the alternative form is: Xxx.Xxx_Account/System.Account/id = '[%CurrentUser%]'

Q: unsaved changes on an in-memory object remain when you cancel editing

Q: how to bookmark an application page?
A: Use the Deep Link module from App Store

Q: Mobile-specific homepage only displayed in Mendix Mobile app, but not in mobile Chrome
A:
  There are eight Navigation Profiles that Mendix offers:
      Responsive
      Hybrid tablet app online
      Hybrid tablet app offline
    ! Hybrid phone app online
      Hybrid phone app offline
      Tablet browser
    ! Phone browser
      Native phone

Q: My app doesn't have user management pages
A: Add to navigation the page "Account_Overview" from the "Administration" module.

Q: "Free App" "MxAdmin" unknown user
A: login as demo_administrator. A password for MxAdmin can probably be set with an "After Startup" microflow.

Q: two texts in one cell are sometimes positioned in one line
A: change the Render mode from Text to Paragraph for text widgets so they will show up as separate pieces of text instead of on the same line

Q: validation rule "unique" case sensitive?
A: 
  https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/case-sensitive-database-behavior
  HSQLDB - Case insensitive for sorting, comparing, and string functions.
  POSTGRESQL - Sorting and comparison are case sensitive. They cannot be configured.
    String functions are case insensitive as they are implemented using the ILIKE SQL operator.
  My tests show that sorting is case-insensitive in PostgreSQL

  As for built-in database Mendix generates DDL with the type VARCHAR_IGNORECASE instead of VARCHAR.


Q: run microflow on change of object attribute without Save changes

Q: all validation messages from a microflow disappear if another microflow called "Change Object" with "Refresh on client"

Q: refer "Done" stories in a commit?

Q: add multiple tags to glyphicons and search by tags?
A: The only tagged icons I know are "cog" and "wrench" and their tag is "settings".

Q: validation messages make page resize and the save button escapes from under the mouse cursor when trying to save

Q: How to move arrows in Domain Model?
A: Select the association and then drag its end along the border of an entity


Q:
  During the development of your app, you can preview it whenever you like. As long as nobody is using the app yet, this is perfectly safe to do. Once the app is in production (meaning, it is being used by end-users), be careful to only publish the app once a feature is built completely. Otherwise, your end-users could be confronted with incomplete functionalities.
  
  Studio Pro will not allow you to preview while there are errors in your app, so you cant accidentally break an app thats running in production.

  What?
