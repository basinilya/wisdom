Q: Does "Custom with Rollback" rolls back the additional transactions created by "Custom without Rollback"?

Q: Why at https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/32/lecture/207/4.3-Knowledge-Check-%E2%80%93-Advanced-Error-Handling-Situations
  Question 1: Consider the following scenario, in which the main microflow and the sub-microflow are invoked by the user. The main microflow has Custom without Rollback error handling, and the sub-microflow has Custom with Rollback error handling. In the sub-microflow below, what does the error event achieve?
  [x]It causes the sub-microflow action in the main microflow to throw an error.
  ?
  "Custom without Rollback" does not throw, does it?


Q: Why at https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/32/lecture/207/4.3-Knowledge-Check-%E2%80%93-Advanced-Error-Handling-Situations
  Question 4: What happens if the same microflows are used, but the error handling on the main microflow is Custom with Rollback and the error handling on the sub-microflow is Custom without Rollback?
  [x]The Order, OrderLine, and Log objects are rolled back while the Customer object is committed to the database
  ?
  The accepted answer is the same as for Question 3 although the error from the java action is now handled with "Custom without Rollback" which should create a concurrent transaction for the "Create Log" action.
  So the Log object should not be rolled back.
  
TBD: Savepoints or multiple transactions?
If savepoints aren't used then a "Without rollback" error handling creates a new transaction while keeping the old transaction and both transactions are committed unless the calling microflow rolls back the first transaction. Then only the second transaction is committed.
It seems that "With rollback" does not create a new transaction if there's a savepoint and continues in the same transaction from the savepoint. If there's no savepoint a new transaction is created.
It seems that a savepoint is created before "Without rollback", but it's not created before "With rollback"
    Q: What does Rollback do?
    A: It rolls back to the most recent savepoint. If there's no savepoint the whole transaction is rolled back and a new transaction is started.
    
    Q: When is a savepoint created?
    A: It's created before an action with a "Without rollback" error handling.

Q: What if a sub-microflow saves to DB after error with or without rollback, then re-throws and the calling microflow rolls back?

Question 2: What best describes the Custom without Rollback error handling option?
[x]A new transaction is initiated, the microflow follows the designated error flow, and all the database commits preceding the error action are preserved.
and not
[ ]The existing transaction is continued, and all the changes made before and after the error will be committed to the database.

  Question 1: When localize is set to No, the date displayed in the client is based on the:
  [x]Client time zone

  [ ]UTC value

  [x]The Client timezone
  and not
  [ ]The User timezone
  ?

Q: Before Commit returning false, but without error does not stop a microflow (it prevents "Save changes" on click action though)
Some autocommitted objects still existed on logout for session 'demo_administrator'.
Autocommitted objects are newly created objects which were not yet committed, but are inserted into the database because an associated object was committed.
Autocommitted objects should explicitly have been committed, please check your model and apply the necessary changes. The autocommitted objects have been deleted from the database to prevent database corruption.Number of autocommitted objects per type which still existed for this session:
- Expenses.TeamMember: 1 object(s).

Q:
  During the development of your app, you can preview it whenever you like. As long as nobody is using the app yet, this is perfectly safe to do. Once the app is in production” (meaning, it is being used by end-users), be careful to only publish the app once a feature is built completely. Otherwise, your end-users could be confronted with incomplete functionalities.
  
  Studio Pro will not allow you to preview while there are errors in your app, so you can’t accidentally break an app that’s running in production.
