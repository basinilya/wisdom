  Or if the widget to choose is an input widget then use a property of type "Attribute" and set it to the same attribute as the input widget. Then find the widget by the attribute.

Q:
  During the development of your app, you can preview it whenever you like. As long as nobody is using the app yet, this is perfectly safe to do. Once the app is in production” (meaning, it is being used by end-users), be careful to only publish the app once a feature is built completely. Otherwise, your end-users could be confronted with incomplete functionalities.
  
  Studio Pro will not allow you to preview while there are errors in your app, so you can’t accidentally break an app that’s running in production.

  What?

Repeat these steps for the caption of the button.
