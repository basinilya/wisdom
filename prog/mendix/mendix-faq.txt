Q: default administrator credentials
A: username: MxAdmin and password: 1

Q: Check the state of an object ("Instantiated", "Committed", dirty) without using java
A: somewhat - isNew()

Q: how to debug custom java
A: locally - when you deploy for Eclipse it creates a launch configuration for that. Remotely, I don't know.

Q: Error during startup in Eclipse
A: eclipse project properties -> Java Build Path -> Execution Environment -> JavaSE-11

Q: Log a message
A:
		ILogNode logger = Core.getLogger(ENU_LogModule.MyFirstModule.name());
		logger.info("some");
		logger.error(new Exception());


Q: get current request
A:
	// BEGIN EXTRA CODE
	private String getClientIp() {
		IContext ctx = getContext();
		Optional<IMxRuntimeRequest> orr = ctx.getRuntimeRequest();
		String realIP = null;
		if (orr.isPresent()) {
		    IMxRuntimeRequest rr = orr.get();
		    HttpServletRequest request = rr.getHttpServletRequest();
		    realIP = rr.getHeader("X-Real-IP");
		    if( realIP == null )
		        realIP = rr.getHeader("X-Forwarded-For");
		    if( realIP == null )
		        realIP = rr.getRemoteAddr();
		}
		return realIP;
	}
	// END EXTRA CODE


Q: Redirect the logs to a custom logging framework
A:
  In "After startup":
	@java.lang.Override
	public java.lang.Void executeAction() throws Exception
	{
		// BEGIN USER CODE
		LogSubscriber subs = new LogSubscriber("mysubscr", LogLevel.TRACE) {
			@Override
			public void processMessage(LogMessage arg0) {
				System.out.println(arg0.message);
			}
		};
		Core.registerLogSubscriber(subs);

Q: Jave Thread name in log messages to extract message sequences for specific threads.
A: It's not logged. See what object is passed to com.mendix.logging.impl.LogManager.registerLogSubscriber and maybe reconfigure it or extend its class.
  Or register your own LogSubscriber that logs the current thread and or current HTTP request.

Q: Integrate Java Actions that use other logging frameworks
A: In "After startup"
  register an appender that calls Core.getLogger ... info/error/...
  Make sure it doesn't recursively call the same logging framework via LogSubscriber


Q: Reference Selector vs Reference Set Selector vs Input Reference Set Selector
A: These widgets allow editing associations. They require the current object to be an association owner. They still require the "Save" button.

Reference Selector only works with "one to x" associations. It can associate one or zero parent objects with the current object. In drop-down mode it displays a chosen attribute of the parent object.

The other two widgets only work with "many to many" associations" and they require a _Select page with a list view of unfiltered parent candidates and a "Save changes" button.
When this pop-up window is invoked by one of the selector widgets it gains an implicit checkbox widget in each row of the list view and the "Save changes" button associates the checked parents with the current child object without committing it.

Input Reference Set Selector looks like a readonly dropdown in which the chosen attribute of the selected parents is shown in a comma-separated list. It also has an active trigger button that invokes the _Select pop-up. In the pop-up already associated objects have their checkboxes checked.

Reference Set Selector looks like a data grid and displays the attributes of parent objects. By default it has "Search Bar Toggle", "Add", and "Remove" buttons. The "Add" button invokes the _Select pop-up. In the pop-up already associated objects don't have their checkboxes checked and it looks like a bug in Mendix 8.17.0. However, checking them does not cause any error.
Besides, Reference Set Selector ignores the readonlyness of the current container.


Q: Why at https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/36/lecture/200/3.4-Knowledge-Check
  Question 4: In which of the following microflows would applying entity access NOT be recommended?
  [x]A microflow to display a company overview to anonymous users.
  and not
  [ ]A microflow that generates a report on the productivity of all the app users.

Q: standard list view CSS classes
A: 
  ,

Q: Ternary operator (?:) in expressions
A: In Mendix if-then-else is not void and can be used in expressions: 'c' + (if true then 'a' else 'u') + 't'

Q: What kind of tokens does the at-sign (@) precede in expressions? Ex:
  @EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV.EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV + '/' + toString (EPM_REF_APPS_PROD_MAN_SRV.EntitySetNames.Products) + '?$filter=substringof(SubCategoryName,''' + urlEncode($SearchCriteria/Term) + ''')'
A: Constants

Q: How to implement a custom microflow activity that runs other activities placed in it just like the Loop activity does?

Q: Custom functions in expressions (client or runtime or both)?

Q: How to delay searching in a data widget until the search button is pressed?

Q: Custom widget with a property where I select another widget on the page?
A: You can't. Instead use a string property and use the widget name. See List View Swipe/Target list view.
  Or have no property and just dynamically find the adjacent widget. See List View controls.
  Or if the widget to choose is an input widget then use a property of type "Attribute" and set it to the same attribute as the input widget. Then find the widget by the attribute.

Q: When are alerts cleared?

Q: if starting with Mendix 7 the object cache only exists on client how does the cached retrieve by association work?

Q: How to create an error handler in a microflow?
A: Right click an action and choose "Set error handling...", drag an outgoing sequence flow, right click the arrow and choose "Set as error handler" (important).

Q: View the development database
A: Console view: Advanced/Start built-in database viewer (maybe requires a running app)

Q: https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/37/lecture/3066/4.4-Summary

  Where?

Q: How does Retrieve work in microflows in case of no read access to _some_ attributes (when entity access is enforced)?

Q: Does Entity Access apply to Retrieve in Microflows without that checkbox checked?
A: looks like it doesn't

Q: Do Log Levels persist between runs in Studio Pro?
A: yes

Q: Why at https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/374/lecture/3053/7.8-Knowledge-Check
  Question 1: When localize is set to No, the date displayed in the client is based on the:
  [x]Client time zone
  and not
  [ ]UTC value
  ?
A: must be poor wording. Tests show that it's based on the UTC value

Q: Why at https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/374/lecture/3053/7.8-Knowledge-Check
  Question 3: If both the Project and User time zone are set, the value of the localized DateTime attribute displayed in the client is according to:
  [x]The Client timezone
  and not
  [ ]The User timezone
  ?
A: The answer is correct. The localized time is based on the browser timezone and ignores the user timezone.

Q: In what timezone do date arithmetic functions in microflows work, especially when working with non-localized date attributes?
A: in the caller timezone. Alternatively, use the xxxUTC() variants of the functions like addDaysUTC()

Q: how to change association direction in domain model?
A: the button is only available in Mendix Studio (Web)

Q: Do non-persistable objects stay after page refresh?
A: no

Q: When retrieving in batches with custom Limit/Offset it's very easy to miss some objects or process them twice if the records were deleted/inserted during retrieval
A: this is mentioned in the courses: https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/21/lecture/85/3.3-Using-Batches
  > The new record set is retrieved, but since you didn’t define a sort order, the retrieve arbitrarily returns the list in no specific order
  So use sorting and maybe it will help. Sorting by internal id is not supported anyway and we don't know if the internal ID monotonic. So use autonumber attribute.

Q: Why instead of setting a role-based home page for Anonymous I have to make the login page default home page and set the role-based home page for every other role?
  https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/183/lecture/1426/3.7.3-Creating-a-Custom-Login-Page
  > Open the Project Navigation and set the newly created login page as the Default home page.
A: No good reason. Anonymous-specific home page works fine.

Q: When uploading a logo via Theme Customizer (web) a GUID is appended to the file path in the .scss file. What is it?

Q: Send %CurrentObject% to a microflow associated with the "New" button in a data grid
A: data grid button "New" pre-associates the new object when the grid datasource is "By Association". It can't do that for other data sources.

Q:
  https://gettingstarted.mendixcloud.com/link/module/184/lecture/1440/4.3-The-Reference-Set-Selector
  > The reference set selector is the widget you use in Mendix to select associated objects ...
  > You can configure the widget to show the options in a dropdown or in a select page
  You can't make it dropdown


Q: buttons with pull-right class have inverted order in design mode

Q: New pages not listed in "page access"
A: Fill "Visible for" in page properties

Q: Before Commit returning false, but without error does not stop a microflow (it prevents "Save changes" on click action though)
Some autocommitted objects still existed on logout for session 'demo_administrator'.
Autocommitted objects are newly created objects which were not yet committed, but are inserted into the database because an associated object was committed.
Autocommitted objects should explicitly have been committed, please check your model and apply the necessary changes. The autocommitted objects have been deleted from the database to prevent database corruption.Number of autocommitted objects per type which still existed for this session:
- Expenses.TeamMember: 1 object(s).


Q: Image Viewer not updated when new image is selected in Image Uploader widget
A: Image Uploader actually uploads the file only when you click the "Save" button on the same page. It somehow detects the proper button and chains itself to the button's action.

Q: How does the Image Uploader widget subscribe to the form submit and how does it distinguish real submit and the cancel action? How does it make sure the upload precedes the user-configured action?

Q: how to cancel changes when editor page abandoned by clicking navigation menu?


Q: Theme Customizer page
A: Mendix Studio, "brush" button at bottom-left

Q: "Edit in Studio" button is missing
A: Go to "My Apps", invoke the ellipsis "..." menu and click "Edit in Studio"

Q: "Mendix Studio is not enabled for this app. Read how to enable Mendix Studio in https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/settings/general-settings"
A: In App Settings/General click "Enable Mendix Studio"

Q: No Development Line Selected
  Mendix Studio is not yet enabled for a development line of this app.
  Assign it to a specific development line in Mendix Studio Pro to start
  collaborative development!
  https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/collaborative-development

Q: "Could not enable the branch for Mendix Studio"

Q: Regular input widgets label width

Q:
  From "Unlocking True Collaboration"
  > Now you should be able to see the file in your project directory if you follow the path: Project directory/javasource/myfirstmodule/datasets/
  Actually the data set is stored in the project .mpr file

Q: This code from Crash Course needs a comment why "==" is used instead of equals():
        public boolean hasRequiredSkill() {
            return employee.getSkill().toString() == this.skill;
        }
        
Q: Non-descriptive field names in generated code:
  public class Java_action extends CustomJavaAction<java.util.List<IMendixObject>>
  {
  	private IMendixObject __Parameter;
  	private usermanager.proxies.Employee Parameter;
      private IMendixObject __Parameter_2;

Q: get Mendix object ID
A: CommunityCommons/GetGUID()

Q: get object by ID string
A: 
  Mendix 7 had the form: id('ID_123423462342 ID_123423462343 ID_123423462344')
  https://docs.mendix.com/refguide7/xpath-id

  There's an alternative syntax:
  https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/xpath-expressions
  //Sales.Customer[Sales.Customer_Order = 'ID_124123512341']
  
  However they both aren't supported by Mendix 8

Q: How to filter in Retrieve by ID? How to obtain the ID of an object? How to sort in Retrieve by ID?
A: you can't

Q: escaping in XPath
A: concat() is not supported. Use XML entities. Ex:
  Larry "Basher" O'Niven
  [attr = 'Larry "Basher" O&apos;Niven']
  [attr = "Larry &quot;Basher&quot; O'Niven"]
  This totally works in Mendix 8 in datasource constraints in data widgets

Q: escaping in OQL

Q: escaping in expressions
A: partial answer: SQL-like double apostrophe
  @GWSAMPLE_BASIC.GWSAMPLE_BASIC + '/' + toString(GWSAMPLE_BASIC.EntitySetNames.ProductSet) + '(''HT-1000'')'
  This produces the GET request https://sapes5.sapdevcenter.com/sap/opu/odata/iwbep/GWSAMPLE_BASIC/ProductSet('HT-1000')


Q: Why can I compare '[%CurrentUser%]' with the association Xxx.Xxx_Account and not Xxx.Xxx_Account/System.Account ?
A: Because the alternative form is: Xxx.Xxx_Account/System.Account/id = '[%CurrentUser%]'

Q: unsaved changes on an in-memory object remain when you cancel editing

Q: how to bookmark an application page?
A: Use the Deep Link module from App Store

Q: Mobile-specific homepage only displayed in Mendix Mobile app, but not in mobile Chrome
A:
  There are eight Navigation Profiles that Mendix offers:
      Responsive
      Hybrid tablet app online
      Hybrid tablet app offline
    ! Hybrid phone app online
      Hybrid phone app offline
      Tablet browser
    ! Phone browser
      Native phone

Q: My app doesn't have user management pages
A: Add to navigation the page "Account_Overview" from the "Administration" module.

Q: "Free App" "MxAdmin" unknown user
A: login as demo_administrator. A password for MxAdmin can probably be set with an "After Startup" microflow.

Q: two texts in one cell are sometimes positioned in one line
A: change the Render mode from Text to Paragraph for text widgets so they will show up as separate pieces of text instead of on the same line

Q: validation rule "unique" case sensitive?
A: 
  https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/case-sensitive-database-behavior
  HSQLDB - Case insensitive for sorting, comparing, and string functions.
  POSTGRESQL - Sorting and comparison are case sensitive. They cannot be configured.
    String functions are case insensitive as they are implemented using the ILIKE SQL operator.
  My tests show that sorting is case-insensitive in PostgreSQL

  As for built-in database Mendix generates DDL with the type VARCHAR_IGNORECASE instead of VARCHAR.


Q: run microflow on change of object attribute without Save changes

Q: all validation messages from a microflow disappear if another microflow called "Change Object" with "Refresh on client"

Q: refer "Done" stories in a commit?

Q: add multiple tags to glyphicons and search by tags?
A: The only tagged icons I know are "cog" and "wrench" and their tag is "settings".

Q: validation messages make page resize and the save button escapes from under the mouse cursor when trying to save

Q: How to move arrows in Domain Model?
A: Select the association and then drag its end along the border of an entity


Q:
  During the development of your app, you can preview it whenever you like. As long as nobody is using the app yet, this is perfectly safe to do. Once the app is in production” (meaning, it is being used by end-users), be careful to only publish the app once a feature is built completely. Otherwise, your end-users could be confronted with incomplete functionalities.
  
  Studio Pro will not allow you to preview while there are errors in your app, so you can’t accidentally break an app that’s running in production.
