======== create audio CD image with imgburn =============
- create wav files out of mp3 files:
ex: ffmpeg -y -i test.mp3 -ar 44100 -ac 2 -acodec pcm_s16le test.wav

- in imgburn switch to write mode
- press small button "create CUE file" in the center of the window
- add tracks (all wav files, CD-audio format, important for mounting)
- press ok and save
- exit write mode

Now you have a wav/cue file which is image and can be mounted with daemon tools!


To create a single bin/cue file
(Although in build mode ImgBurn recognizes the cue file as an image file, it then creates a data cd containing the cue file itself instead of an audio cd with the tracks.)
Instead:
- mount wav/cue file with daemon tools
- in imgburn switch to read mode
- save as *.bin (cue file created automatically)
